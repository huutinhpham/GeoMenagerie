GeoMenagerie
===================================

# Overview

This projects renders 3D objects by using triangle mesh, and half-edges. The curve of an object is determined by Bezier's patch. With loop division, and half-edge data structure I increased the amount of triangles within the mesh, essentially improve the rendered surface. After the object is rendered, shaders such as Blinn-Phong, and reflective shaders are applied.
